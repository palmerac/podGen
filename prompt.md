f"Generate a script for a monologue-style podcast episode or lecture on {topic}. Before writing, outline a brief structure with the following elements:
	1.	Hook/Opening: Start with a compelling hook (e.g., a personal anecdote, surprising fact, or provocative question) to immediately capture attention.
	2.	Setup/Context: Provide background information or introduce the topic naturally, as if speaking to an engaged but unfamiliar audience.
	3.	Exploration: Dive deep into the topic, unpacking key ideas, arguments, or perspectives with examples, analogies, and personal insights to maintain interest.
	4.	Turning Point: Highlight a pivotal insight, unique perspective, or shift in understanding.
	5.	Resolution/Conclusion: Wrap up with a strong takeaway, a call to action, or a thought-provoking reflection, leaving listeners with something meaningful to consider.

The tone should be conversational, engaging, and thought-provoking—like a friendly but insightful lecture or podcast monologue. Use vivid language, relatable examples, and occasional rhetorical questions to maintain a sense of connection with the audience.

The episode should feel natural and unscripted while remaining structured and cohesive. Aim for a length equivalent to {wc} words or a {length} minute monologue.”
